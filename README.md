The dataset is about bankruptcy prediction of Polish companies. The data was collected from Emerging Markets Information Service (EMIS), which is a database containing information on emerging markets around the world. The bankrupt companies were analyzed in the period 2000-2012, while the still operating companies were evaluated from 2007 to 2013. datasetLink:"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Polish+companies+bankruptcy+data"
